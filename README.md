# Initial Problem Statement 1

Ben, a PhD student researching Southern yellow-billed hornbill birds, needs a way to acquire the data from the cameras rigged to take pictures and monitor the birds, without having to climb a ladder to get the data.

# PS1 feedback

- Interfacing with existing cameras is going to be difficult
- reasearch the kind of data, resolution, battery life and range the the stakeholders want
- Then we can do the literature review
