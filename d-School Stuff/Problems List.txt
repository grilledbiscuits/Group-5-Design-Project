PROBLEM 1:  SOUTHERN YELLOW-BILLED HORNBILLS
	The main challenge of this problem is to cool down the boxes the birds live in (max 50.6 degrees)
	The boxes are 1.5m above ground and are monitored via camera
	There are issues with the camera recording too late/missing something entirely/general unreliability
	The interior of the box must remain wood
	The current measuring process is as follows:
		The lid of the box is lifted
		The female is lifted with a pillowcase(?)
		All the chicks are measured
		Everyone is replaced and the lid goes back on
PROBLEM 2: THE DRONGOS
	The main challenge for these guys is basically just to measure their body masses against their nesting temperature
	They range in weight from 42-62g with a mean of 50g. We would need an error margin of less than 5g
	Owls eat the chicks in the twilight hours, so nests will have to be monitored, especially at these times
	Same issues with camera unreliability. I don't really know which problem actually mentioned it but it's pretty obvious that it's 	important to these guys
	The process for recording the drongos is as follows:
		Climb up (some object. I imagine a pole or something)
		Fetch the camera
		Collect the recorded data and replace the battery
		Put the camera back and climb down
PROBLEM 3: GROUND HORNBILL
	Live in artificial nests 4m above ground and nested in or near the centre of a tree
	Nests are around 40cm wide x 60cm deep x >110cm height (the birds are around 110cm tall)
	The birds weigh between around 3-5kg
	Can expect anything between 2 to 11 birds at any given point in time
	The aim of the client is to investigate the impact of temperature and available food
	Another main issue is the long drives between spots and climbing a 6m ladder to measure chicks manually, swap camera traps
	These birds are very shy. They can only be measured while nesting
	Anything visible/hearable will be destroyed
	Max battery capacity of 2-3 weeks (?!?!?!?!)
	There will often be multiple birds in the nest at the same time
	A scale recording threshold of >2kg is recommended
	A camera must be recording the nest as a weight reading is taken
	These birds sometimes land and perch on the nest roof
	Point of Interest: These guys have unique faces and unique calls. My mind went to AI but I'm pretty sure it would take 3 years of 	a team of 20 to produce anything useful in that regard
	Only females and chicks chill in the nest, but there's also food and other rubbish going in and out of there so measuring is 	unreliable at best
	The "perches" in front of the nests can have some give/wobble/movement without bugging them
	This is, by far, in my opinion, the most difficult problem on our roster. I don't know if that is gonna make some of you curious 	to what we can do, but if we end up running with this we're gonna have to be ready to work hard
PROBLEM 4: SECRETARY BIRDS
	The main problem here is literally just camera stability. The homie had a GoPro on a long pole and it swayed in the wind, but if 	we run with this I'm sure we can give him more than one of those concrete umbrella stands
	Visible wires are not allowed
	The entire system itself shouldn't be too visible, either
	This whole thing is to monitor birds that nest on the tops of trees
	This definitely seems like the easiest problem on our roster
PROBLEM 5: RED-WINGED STARLINGS
	This is an on-campus project. The aim is to study the breeding pattern of these guys
	Require cameras to watch nests that won't get stolen by passers-by
	Would like to last with no charge for up to 2 MONTHS
	Livestreaming capabilities would be a bonus
	Scales to auto-record weights (150-160g MAX)
